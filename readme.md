Clustr is an Adobe Air desktop application built to help you work better with Huddle.

## History

This project was formerly (as in, years ago) known as Huddle Desktop when I built it back in 2008. I support it to this day, you lucky people :)

It is recommended all users of Huddle Desktop switch over to this new codebase. It is significantly more stable, with more advanced error and file transfer handling, and more sophisticated in general.

## Features

Clustr Desktop is the re-release of Huddle Desktop, with a whole new codebase and a huge range of new features. Product features include:

* View your Workspaces, Folders and Files
* What's New feeds for Workspaces
* View detailed information on Files
* For Windows, Mac OSX and Linux
* All-new code for Version 2
* No private data stored, saved passwords encrypted
* No Ads, always 100% free, forever!

## Users

It is recommended users first check out the [official website](http://clustr.me.uk/desktop) for general information and installation.

If you find an issue, you can check out the Issues tab above to see if it has been reported before, or you could report it and a developer will get back to you.

There is also the Wiki for more detailed installation instructions.

## Development

Code contributions are more than welcome, you know the drill on how to do it. I don't have as much time as I'd like to track down AIR's various inconsistencies and quirks and write around them.
